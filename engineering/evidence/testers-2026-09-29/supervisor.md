# Supervisor notes — 2026-09-29 tester run

- 19:00Z start. Tokens t0929-1..6 minted 19:02–19:08Z (t0929-5 needed a second try: a TLS
  handshake reset from the container's egress proxy during a poll; the first precheck's nonce was
  never spent). Six anonymous prechecks and six token starts used of the day's 20 and 10.
- 19:05Z wave 1 launched: 15 agents, then 402-A/B/C at 19:09Z once t0929-5 existed (the times in this file are read from `date -u`, not guessed; the first draft of this line guessed and was wrong by seven minutes).
- 19:09Z 69-C reports my assignment was built on a misread: erdos-69--h1-v2 (proved) *is* the
  prime-sum identity, and h2-v2 is the irrationality given it (circular by a merged claim). So
  69-A's speculative node would re-prove a proved statement and 69-C's skeleton would duplicate
  the merged 2026-09-17 one. 69-C redirected to an annex on h2-v2 plus a skeleton of it with the
  literature's ingredients as holes; 69-A redirected to prove one such ingredient. Lesson for the
  bug list: the problem page shows h1-v2 as "proved" and h2-v2 as "circular" but not what either
  says, so a planner reading the page (me) assigned work that was already done.
