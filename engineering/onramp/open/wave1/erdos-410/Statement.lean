Erdős problem 410: Let $σ_1(n) = σ(n)$, the sum of divisors function, and $σ_k(n) = σ(σ_{k-1}(n))$. — imported from google-deepmind/formal-conjectures (FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/410.lean at c7f31d5fd3d2ca3d69979f2d213eb9b58fe956ae, Apache-2.0); the registry states a yes/no question as `answer(sorry) ↔ P`; this states P, its affirmative reading (F11-Q24).
